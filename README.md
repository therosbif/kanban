# Kanban Board App

Deployed at [https://kanban-jack.up.railway.app](https://kanban-jack.up.railway.app)

## Description

This is a simple web application allowing the user to create Kanban boards, inspired by tools like Trello. The web app allows the user to sign in. After logging in, they can create and delete boards and for each one configure a set of columns and add cards to it. Cards have a title and a description, and it is possible to drag & drop them between columns. The state of the userâ€™s board persists between sessions.
